# Sentiment & Engagement Trends in Social Media: A Case Study on Radio Host

## Introduction

Public sentiment plays a crucial role in shaping the reputation of public figures, especially in the media industry. Recently, a Facebook post discussing why **famous radio hosts failed to expand their reach** in another part of the country sparked public debate.

To understand **why this happened and what the public thinks**, we conducted an in-depth sentiment analysis of the comments on this post. However, **not all comments carry the same weight**â€”some receive hundreds of likes, making them **more influential** in shaping overall sentiment.

This project explores **how weighting sentiment based on likes** can provide a more **accurate** representation of public opinion.

## Objectives

- **Perform sentiment analysis** to classify public opinion into positive, neutral, or negative categories.
- **Prioritize high-engagement comments** by giving more weight to comments with higher likes.
- **Identify trending discussion topics** using NLP techniques.
- **Explore correlations** between comment length, sentiment, and engagement.
- **Demonstrate the power of feature weighting** in sentiment analysis.

### Real-World Applications:
- **Brand reputation management** (analyzing customer feedback).
- **Political sentiment analysis** (measuring voter perception).
- **Social media monitoring** (identifying trends and controversies).

## Data Overview

The dataset consists of:
- **Comments**: User-generated opinions on the Facebook post.
- **Likes**: The number of likes each comment received (used as a weight for importance).

By analyzing this data, we aim to **understand the public mood and identify dominant narratives**.

![Comment Length vs Likes](visuals/comment_length_vs_likes.png)

### Findings:
- **Weak negative correlation (`-0.367`)**, meaning **shorter comments tend to receive more likes**.
- **Longer comments provide more detail but are less engaging** for casual users.

## 6. What Drives Engagement? Correlation Analysis

We examined relationships between **sentiment, comment length, and number of likes**.

| Metric | Spearman Correlation |
|--------|----------------------|

# Conclusion: Why This Matters

This analysis **proves the power of weighting user engagement in sentiment analysis**. If we had performed **basic sentiment analysis**, the overall sentiment would have been **misleading**.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Negative sentiment dominates public discourse** and drives engagement.
- **Feature weighting (likes) alters sentiment perception**, revealing more accurate public opinion.
- **Shorter, sharp comments attract more likes**, while long-form comments go unnoticed.
