 Everyone I speak to absolutely is disgusted by these two bullies & can't believe they are still employed.,323
they were beaten by ABC local radio,1500
One of the most embarrassing things about Australia is that we have people who listen to these two.,1400
"What’s even more sacrilegious Is these two aren’t Melburnians	 they are high Jacking our airways.",171
Can't believe the world we live in when they get paid so much but the people who deserve it like nurses paramedics doctors and other occupations that really make a difference struggle to get paid what they are worth,1700
I hope they donate to charities! So many are doing it tough!,96
Wouldn’t walk to the back door to listen to Kyle!,193
I got a question. Did someone win the noise cause I noticed the other day the noise has changed however I cannot find a winner anywhere or find what the last noise was?,6
"NO radio host deserves that amount of money a year! Just give me 1 of them and I could generate more interest in Melbourne! Those 2 are SO far past the common man	 they're in a world of their own self importance and awareness",221
If I had a choice of having to listen to their absolute  dribbling or complete silence. Silence would win 1 Billion times over.,134
OMG! Moved from Sydney to Melbourne 4 yrs ago and hoped I'd never have to hear the hype about them ever again!,180
Melbourne can see a couple of drop kicks from a mile away.,422
"Yesterday I was flicking stations and came across them having a conversation about Kyle's first time using cocaine	 and that he always has been and always will be a weed head. How is this appropriate on commercial radio??",165
Hope they fail miserably....both has beens,114
"My god	 somebody make Labrat wear a mask.",10
We here in Melbourne  have taste,329
Get out!,42
Why do we in Melbourne want to listen to a Sydney breakfast show ?,156
Thank goodness all that talk blowing them up like some superstars,22
Do they live in Melbourne or in Sydney. Of they doing the show from Sydney then maybe they should just stay in Sydney,31
Done and dusted they should have not played with the underdogs we all love,39
Need someone from Melbourne,9
Wouldn’t listen to them if you payed me. Stay in Sydney don’t need you here.,40
they were never going to convince Melbourne!,30
I don't understand how people in Sydney like them. I'm from Sydney and it makes me realise why the rest of the country hates us...this is our no.1 radio show?,873
"After the way the station handled the sacking of their morning presenters	 I decided to boycott them by not listening.",40
I hate Kyle,71
can they remove them from Brisbane's radio too.... i hate driving home from work and its them or the news - i rather listen to the news!,312
Not the least bit interested in hearing  these two,810
Today in the morning Kyle spoke about his cocaine use and put it in glowing terms. Nothing but disgust in how this is going on radio and I thought the sordid talk was bad. Utter garbage from these people and KIIS for allowing this,120
I would need to be paid $10 million a year to listen to them. Both overrated in my opinion,1400
How these two incredibly unintelligent people are so popular is beyond me. Has our communal intellectual capability fallen so low that this happens?,45
Yeah they can go.,13
I'd rather have nails hammered into my ears than listen to their Sydney centric rubbish.,11
I’d love them to take their obscene and grubby chat show back to Sydney. We have more class than that!!!!,109
"Wouldn’t it be great if the radio station chose kind	 positive hosts from Melbourne that don’t demand such a high salary and use the excess money to help build public housing?",70
Too big for themselves,28
No one is worth that wage especially some of the dribble they put out,69
"I loved kiis until Jase	 Lauren and Clint left. Couldn’t stand Jackie o and Kyle	 so would surf channels. Once I heard they were back at Nova	 I jumped ship!",293
i totally agree cant stand kyle,35
This has to be a joke this money should be spent where needed omg,28
It's time for them to go.  Their old.,30
"I am a dedicated Gold listener	 and love hearing the Christian O’Connell Show.  I guess that there are other good brekkie shows in Melbourne - each to their own taste.  However	 I think that Kyle and Jackie think they are better than anyone else and de… See more",126
"I love that they think it’s promising because they were only on for 3 of the 10 weeks of the ratings!! They may find once they are on for the full 10 weeks	 it’ll be even worse  … See more",150
I lasted 5 minutes Shocking radio,44
Use to listen to KISS but now follow Nova because they pushed out the other two. Who wants to listen to a show from Sydney anyway?,82
I don’t know how Kyle (and Jacki o) are allowed on air Over the last 10+ years whenever I’ve heard them on the radio their conversations are nonsense and completely inappropriate for the radio and young ears. Please put someone impressive in the radio. Thanks.,546
Ridiculous Of course they not lol hehe too funny Who?,3
Eric Cartman & Jackie o,50
It was obvious to anyone who was objective that Melbourne wouldn’t take kindly to two locals being kicked off the radio for two Sydney stars. Then you add in the foul content and complete lack of humility and you have a guarantee of failure. I listene… See more,20
Stay in Sydney.,51
They are foul !,18
Wouldn’t listen to these flogs even if they were the only radio station on air,11
"Who is actually listening to these two idiots…I can’t stand either of them. I cannot believe how much they get paid for doing nothing. There are surgeons and nurses and rescue workers etc who actually save lives and can’t even fathom earning that much … See more There podcast is ranked No 1 in Australia by a country mile .. So you must be listening to them Good luck with that……nobody is worth that salary	especially those 2. Anyway if the sponsors get a return on investment to pay that salary	 well ?????????? Think about it Yayay love it anything that can get rid of them is great	 (kylie is an over paid	 dummy spitting wanka)	 especially in favour of loz	 Jase and Clint yay team bring it xxxx	 love you guys haven't listened to kiss since and I listened to kiss for years They're not worth $10	 but all power to them if they can con 10 million out of a radio network to convince them they'll make it in Melbourne.I'm amazed they're on the airwaves Can anyone justify their $10m a year salaries??? What are they contributing that is so life changing for the community??? F me! The pre show marketing campaign in Melb for Kyle and Jackie O misfired.  All on the other programs	 same station was  “all the marketing money is going to the Sydney people so we are doing bin stickers “. It was shocker. How ridiculous not well earned at all Why am I not surprised that they are not doing well in Melbourne. Please go back to Sydney you two. That was the worst decision you made. We don’t won’t bullies in Melbourne. How did they convince anyone? Thats because they are crap	 Melbourne radio stations have class and integrity. What do these two have ? Not a fan of Kyle never have can’t deal with his arrogance - I’d rather listen to soap opera 24/7 than his irritating voice Failure on management for not doing appropriate due diligence on their fit  for the Melbourne market! Great to see! Hope their ratings take even more of a dive. A great big buffoon 3AW is the best to listen too  Ross and Russel in the morning 	 Tom Elliot 	have our radio on all day I would love to be a fly on the wall when Kyle found out	 and how he reacted",4
"Fifi	 Fev & Nick are the best! Cannot even compete! Goodluck Kyle and Jackie O 	 you’ll need it Why do they have convince people in Melbourne contracts signed good luck to them if they can neg a deal like that Not Melbourne people we only want Melbourne people on our Radio Sounds like Melbourne I don’t know a single person who’s ever liked them. I can’t believe they’re still going	 especially that toad Kyle They’re definitely not worth that. I’d rather pay them $10M to not speak Come on - sitting behind a microphone and making disparaging comments about just about anyone and everything is worth every cent - of about 10 bucks Cannot stand Kyle. What a Can we please get rid of them… go back to Sydney I wouldn't contaminate my radio with those two! It's already bad enough with useless	 overhyped presenters as it is. Oh how I yearn for the old days when there was genuine entertainment. nobody and i mean NOBODY is worth that disgusting amount of money. they do less than the average worker working their butts off to take home a pittance They are $30 grand a year people 	 the rest evenly spread to those who despise them and everything they stand for. Give me Gold Fm any day of the week Can’t stand these Sydney idiots trying to take over OUR air waves I used to like them but I can’t stand Kyle anymore he so arrogant!! I'd rather sit in silence driving home",6
"How is talking on a radio station a few hours a day Monday-Friday worth that much? That’s what is wrong with the world. People like this get paid insane amount and people who actually risk their lives and make an impact don’t receive anything remotely close to that. Who are the people that voted these two in?! I’d really like to know…. 10 weeks of rating from ever other station compared to 3 for them. Really great reporting Detest Kyle. He's a snake in the grass That's totally disgusting the amount of money they get . Could have told them that before they hired these 2.  I for one would never listen to Kyle. Don't know what time they are on	 I listen to 3AW. who have won all ratings for years. Ross & Russell. No surprise there. Melbourne will never embrace a Sydney based radio breakfast program no matter who they are. No one is worth that much. Charity’s need this money more Well done Melbourne These 2 clowns think they’re worth 10mil? lol I’ve seen funnier jokes come from toilet paper. If you guys want real ratings	 give us a call. I still don’t get why it takes more than 1 announcer to play music. 10 million a year? Wtf	 the amount of adds required to try and recoup that on radio waves	 must be incredible. Jas and Lauren are so much better to listen to than the other shows 	 Kyle sanders is an arrogant bully 	 Jackie O is the definition of a Dumb Blonde ( along with FiFi box) and Fev is just dumb (too many hits to the head from his AFL days) it’s almost … See more I actually prefer alot of the old school music etc from other radio stations more so now. Too much talking and not enough good music I say Kyle is a flog not worth that kind of money Good they can stay in Sydney All good they just need to air Jase and Lauren in Sydney Great! Maybe they will go back to Sydney! Of course they’re not great.  Kiss should never have changed from Jas & Lauren to Kyle & Jackie.  I’ll not listen to 101.1 again I’d rather give it to the boys from NZ - The Morning Shift!!! They’re hilarious!!!",4
"Have not listened to Radio for years by the looks of it nothing's improved since either and 10 million pay wow guys milk it while it's there I spose can't really see the value of that in what you do lol well the World's a funny ol place indeed ....shake my head They are the best I listen to them every morning Kyle and Jackie O are so old and washed up. Not remotely funny or interesting. The radio station should give their slot to Toni and Ryan and move on. Just moved to Melbourne and jeeze...soo many radio stations with people yabbering on all the time. Where are the rock/metal stations at?? Lowbrow stuff like Starbucks	 Big Wheels & Shock Jocks belong in Sydney They should pay us that amount to listen to there crap and even then it would be painful Could have told you that before they disgraced our airwaves... Wait people still listen to the radio ? That’s because we love Melbourne Sydney radio is so different help . They assumed and thought  Melbournians are same as Sydney people. Too bad Still number 1 in Sydney.. go Kyle and Jackie O With so many haters don’t go to their giveaways or ask for the give back then how boring abc radio  sounds super exciting NOT Ten million a year??? R U Serious? Is that each or between them? Dear God its a morning radio show. Who cares when we got Spotify listen to whatever we want I LOVE THEM... TEAM KYLE & JACKIE O Sydney can keep 'em! Get them off our Melbourne radios! I do not know why they are paid this amount of money for the disgusting topics they talk about !!! I could not believe that they are allowed to talk about what they do and what others do very privately!!!!! It was disgusting! Those topics are NOT suita… See more This is great to hear! Thank you Melbourne for having good taste. I used to love tuning in at 6pm to listen to them but not for breakfast radio though… I think that they do not belong there. So I find myself finding Jase & Lauren in the mornings and the. back to Kyle & Jackie O on the encore show at 6pm Dumb and Dumber No place here in Melbourne The idiot needs a good old slap	 and never be allowed on radio ever again I barely notice them. Took that only one time to listen to them two and they're both flops Kyle is an idiot. I can’t stand him There is something in the world when people are paid $10 million just be obnoxious. I wouldn’t cross the road to see or hear Kyle. Think he’s quite loathsome. I can’t stand these two nothing but gutter talk even in the promos so a big turn off from me Good! That's what happens when they boot Jase and Lauren and not ask Melbourne what they want!! Nova all the way now!!! Stick to who knows Melbourne & it’s not them That is the most accurate thing to come out of the daily mail	 ever. “….and they're not great.” Never a truer word was spoken. No kidding! Anyone could have predicted that Thank goodness	 Victorians have more sense than listen to these two. Dumb strategy. Too much interstate rivalry for this to ever work! Disgusting. Go to uni and get a real job. The world is fcking so wrong 10mil to talk garbage on a radio show No body wanted them to take over - this was inevitable Don't like them at all wouldn't listen at all that's my opinion others might disagree . No one is worth that sort of money for doing their job. Most people wouldn’t earn that in a lifetime of working Always knew Melbourne had taste Yeah they not even worth ten bucks let alone 10 mil........two of the worst radio personalities this country has ever produced n somehow the people paying them n pushing them to be on every states radio shows obviously has no idea n don't realise the o… See more The worst of the industry They are terrible. Where are Fifi Fev and Byron?? They’re in Melbourne????",3
"You're not worth one million a year wtf Never were and never will be worth that much Jackie is just a prop Kyle's unhealthy	 inappropriate and out of date humour was going to wear off eventually. The only shame is that it wasn't sooner rather than later What a joke. Definitely not worth $1mil How/why have that pair ever justified the salary they're paid. Utter rubbish. That Kyle is a flog. They would have to pay me to listen to their pathetic vitriol.",3
"I cant stand them	 Jase and Lauren are so much better Yeah and Jacki was about to get fired over 200	0 Hope Jase and Lauren keep growing there ratings and whoop these 2 out of Melbourne Has beens time to move on $10mill a year?! What the actual F?!",2
"Certainly aren't worth anything like 10 million. Kyle really gaslights these radio show execs that he is worth money They are so cringe	 especially Kyle gross So	 they’ve got a great management company. Kyle is a misogynist. Can't stand him and he talks for far too long about stupid stuff. Jackie O just goes along with his BS. Get rid of them I would rather listen to crying babies than these two pretentious fools I don't listen to radio. Solves that issue. Worst people to listen to Good!  Well done Melbs Waste of dead air !!!!! Melbourne must have some intelligent people. Cash grab these 2 flogs That talk about sexual remarks on radio 10 Million well spent on these 2 clowns that wanna have a naked dating live on radio Wouldn’t pay them $1.80 They are filth - full stop! Who cares what Melbourne thinks I started listening from Perth at Xmas but already seems the same old stories I don't even live there and I still prefer the other two that were on Let’s pay double to get Hamish and Andy back The Christian O'Connor Show with Jack and Pats is still better than any other morning radio!!! No one is worth that salary ever. Nova is far better! Don’t know how Fitzy and Wippa aren’t number 1 Kyle	 the most arrogant	 ignorant	  narcissist	  pathetic human being	 why is he still alive? Absolute brain rot listening to these two If they get paid that much then why are they not helping the homeless	 as on tonight talking about housing. Help instead of talking about it!	 could do alot with a few mil I find their show cringe worthy. So I don’t listen to anything they are on. How could you think of paying for that crap But their material is so good …. It was obvious from the start. Absurd amount of money to pay anyone let alone them! Whatever is wrong with the world! Is anyone worth this amount.	really Can’t stand them. Switched back to NOVA. Does radio still operate? They take every opportunity to take conversations into the gutter. Not OK for breakfast radio or with kids in the car. Jase and Lauren are kinda naff	 but they're funny and relatable. I'll do the show for half a mil a year  and I'm in Melbourne Would not listen to them. What a joke 10 million and there are people out there struggling Not even worth 10 grand Maybe people should read the article first I liked Kylie and Jackie O when I was in Sydney but have loved Jase and Lauren for a while now so I like many other ms have followed them to their new home Nova KIIS stuffed up shuda Left Lauren Jase an Clint where they were Now it looks like we’ve followed them to Nova The conversations they have in the morning are discusting especially if you have kids in the car let alone hearing myself as an adult. Jase and Lauren are so good and funny. Glad the got a shot again on a different station. Vile Kyle and Jackie Oh no	 pfft	 not worth $2 triple j  educated humans	 younger than these two	 discussing actual issues in the world. Not just who’s hooking up with who from mafs last season…. I haven't listened to commercial radio in years	 same with watching commercial tv!! They pushed out other amazing radio hosts to make way for these Sydney crackers. He'll still think he's better than he is how do they justify that kind of money? No one is worth that much money a year.  Drs	 Nurses	 Teachers and police are worth much  more  than they are paid and deserve it more than these people. Neither was Dopey Dan but they gave him a job Disgusting man and Jackie gets brought down to his level If you wanna hear good radio you have to stream the NZ radio stations	  the ones in aus are crap Never have enjoyed listening to these 2 very surprised at their popularity though $10m salaries wtf for what and why  who gave them that?? I cant stand either of them asn so9n as I hear one word from their mouths i changthestation The ratings aren’t great And neither are Kyle and Jackie O The things that Kyle and Jackie O talk about make me cringe. I'm a Nova listener now that Jase and Lauren are back Insane amount of money And people are living in tents Good  ego’s will be dented Melbourne resident here… I had never heard of Jase and Lauren until they landed at Nova	 but I have been enjoying their morning banter on the drive to work. I’ve never heard a moment of Kyle and Jackie-O’s show (unless it’s a clip on Fb that pops up) a… See more Tom Eliot in morn then sen all day n night Everyone listens to spotify they arent worth any money let alone 10mil Totally agree with them.  I change  to Amazon music or Spotify. People just want music not talking on radio stations. unless they want to stream it. Personal preference. They aren’t worth that much money to hear them speak - think of what could be done to help Australians in need with their salary. Ridiculous Can’t stand either of them It must be the new smart state Just listen to 2UE.Great music all day and not having to listen to these idiots I will never listen to their show. Who realistically is worth that amount of cash?? Not worth $10 together Can't stand them ""NSW says """"Hey Melbourne, no backsies . . ."""""" What a crock. Definitely  much better out there and at half their price tag Really who is worth that much honestly! Well this was to be expected lmao Big mistake! Jase was the best! They’re too low brow for Melbourne !! They were once good….back in the early 90’s.  Ego taken over	 just not nice people anymore. Maybe do the Saturday top hit charts again??? They will blame and denigrate Melbourne and Melbournians for not being up to Sydney's standards when they get sacked no doubt. Expensive lesson Kiis Hahaha too soon? I stopped listening to Kiss when they pulled that crap. Kyle is a loser and I enjoyed listening to Jace and Lauren Don't see how someone get 10 Million in a year  don't  care how good thay are  just taking on radio the advantage person wouldn't get that in a lifetime no way there that  amount He Is Absolutely Disgusting. Good take your gazillions and head back to Sydney Honestly I would rather listen to the emergency broadcast system or just static than listen to either of them speak I’m in Melbourne and when I flick to a new radio station and hear them I get the hell out! I don’t know how radio station can even pay them that much They are pathetic these two..hot air no substance Yeah swap stations as soon as I heard Kyle and Jackie were taking over Not worth even 1% of that. I jumped to Nova as well I just always feel good listening to Jase and Lauren Who gives a flying...... Critens Would you listen to the opinion of people who have held the same job since the late 90’s? Tuned in the other day by accident and Kyle were talking about how he couldn't get into a high end designer store...like that's a problem we all have SMH...and Jackie agrees and says something about Gucci brand is tacky? They are not relatable at all! No-one is worth a $10m a year salary.  That is obscene. Because Melbonians have more taste than to listen to them waffling on Who remembers in the 80's when Ch7 ran news for Melbourne out of Sydney? From memory Ch7 news was beaten by Inspector Gadget on the ABC in the same timeslot. Will they never learn every town/state wants it's own voice? Martin Molloy back in the day were much funnier. Kyle and Jackie O are forced humour. Read the actual article. Ratings period wasn't a direct comparison. Jog on No one likes Kyle in Melbourne Nobody is worth that much money....egotistical air heads.... They're a disgrace They are becoming very predictable. People are choosing podcasts over radio unless you’re a boomer. Jase was sooo much better. Effortlessly funny. Why listen to them - better things  to do- rarely listen to any radio thesss ex days- both last ever listen to- dislike his attitudes- don’t watch him in any tv shows either as too smug 	 conceited - could go on - as for her - mmmm - keep them in Sydney Who the hell are these people? keep at it kyle and jacky it will happen Melbournians  understand  Melbournians . Jason and Lauren great combination. Such a shame radio hierarchy don’t know their audience! . I dumped Kiss and followed Jase	 Lauren and Clint over to Nova. Great station to listen to… not just in the mornings That’s bc they’re not worth the money. What a ridiculous amount for two people. It’s gross. People believe everything they read. We're smarter than that we don't listen to them we don't even know what station they're really on if it's real or fake I always listen to 101.1 but not since these 2 have taken over Who listens to the radio. Big mistake on the radios part…. Christian	 Jack and Pats all the way…..Gold 104.3 The way society allocates money is upside down and inside out. There not worth it. Unbelievable. That’s a joke! They’re not even worth $1M. Even John Blackman didn't appreciate them	 wake up Australia and get rid of them Get them off breakfast radio please	 I immediately have to change the station because it's mostly always inappropriate and toxic content while we have the kids in the car. Melbourne thinking  Return to Send please and thank you These stations lost me when they did the prank on that UK nurse during Kate’s pregnancy and and she committed suicide from the humiliation. They should be in goal for manslaughter I don't know anybody that listens to them. If it happened by accident in the car switching stations Both Flogs rather listen to Jason & Lauren any day of the week!!! I hope with everything I have that Jase and Loren kick them off there pearch The fact that anybody would be in the slightest bit interested in anything these massive bogans have to say is super cringe. Aussies supporting these two is like Americans supporting Trump…embarrassing",2
"I personally don’t listen to their show	 but if Melbourne people don’t like it	 maybe I should be They are the worst . Kyle Sunderland is a disgusting	 misogynistic	  narcissistic	 bottom dwelling pos and it's unfathomable how he's become a celebrity. The fact that he's had his own radio show tells us everything about how prehistoric and contam… See more",4
"I fail to see how they are work $10 million in the first place Don't understand why their salaries are that high... I can’t stand Kyle 	 putrid nonsense	 shocking radio rubbish 	 pathetic show off 	 a joke 	 no respect or meaningful conversations	 raving on about his criminal best mate 	 give me a break 	 just disappear!! Who listens to this crap? And why? IF you do your just as crazy as them and make them have salaries of $10million that's absurd! I followed Jase and Lauren to Nova	 could not stand Kyle and Jackie",6
"Bringing broadcasters from interstate bever works......That's $10m down the drain Who do they think they are???? Have never been able to stand him no ones worth that a year especially those to dimwits Best news ever. Good on you Jase and Lauren	 keep up the great work. More music less hearing radio voices in general Worst radio show on earth They were on for 3/10 weeks of the ratings period. Pretty deceptive reporting. Hey tho what do you expect from the tabloids About time people took notice and realise they need to go they think the whole world revolves and them . How do you warrant that kind of money for 36 minutes of adds every hour  ??? Both have been over paid	 over-rated hacks for a long time. Can someone please explain these two vile and obnoxious people. They are not funny 	 have nothing to add to society	in the top 10 horrible people list they are at the top Jade & Lauren and Melbourne royalty! And they’ve got my loyalty! This is evidence that Melbournians are more discerning What a joke. 10 mil are year!!! Revolting people Hahaha did they really think they were gonna come to Melbourne and beat christian and the crew Unfortunately caught their show last Thursday night about 7.30pm	 absolute vomit inducing filth. I could have told you that. Kyle is a flog no matter what city he is in. Go back to Sydney. The radio company has paid a lot of money to purchase the sludge at the bottom of the barrel! They are not even worth .01cent a year.. That’s because Fifi	 Fev and Nick are better	 their show is wholesome well congrats oh the tax they pay realy i dont care I might move to Melbourne! I have no idea why people in Sydney think they're worth. Kyle is revolting! If anyone in a real workplace says what he does they'd be SACKED",3
"How anyone could like that kn*bhead is beyond me..$10mill is a bloody joke. Oh - are they on radio?? Leave them in Melbourne Yeah	 every-time the radio boffins think they can save money by doing this the people vote with their ears. Arrogant Sydneysiders coming to Melbourne radio thinking we will fall in love with their trashy show. $10 million to talk crap	 Nice . The world has gone nuts Some ppl can’t  even afford to buy groceries for their families you could literally just fire every single person who speaks on radio in any way and you'd have a HUGE improvement to the radio station. The Christian O’Connell show is FAR FAR BETTER THAN THESE TWO IDIOTS. When are these radio stations going to learn we are Melbourne not Sydney. cant stand Kyle don't deserve $10 a year	 boring af Can't be much worse than 3AW Not for 10 mill  a year  that's laughable not even 1 mill a year I haven’t listened to the radio for YEARS! I would turn it on in the morning taking the kids to school and it was vile! They're not worth it! I have switched channels because their radio content is not suitable for morning drives to school with kids in the car. They need to stick to night shows",3
They are not worth that money no wonder advertising on Radio is so dear Love how loyal Melbourne is This is the very reason I gave up listening to the radio. Great news! Good they are the worst and I hope kiss fm struggle Sydney crap doesn’t fly in Melbourne.,5
"Well done Loz and Jase your the best for sure They are a joke embarrassing actually Jase and Lauren way better they are awesome. It would have to be a very cold and  lonely wet day before I listen them.. No one is worth $10mil. Homeless	 sick chn	 famillies loosing their homes ....really $10mil salary. Then start to cut those wretched pollies wages we all pay for ! Don’t listen to them. Things he says are pretty gross Don’t like the way they run the radio it’s boring can’t listen to them  I have changed radio listening to the Fox. bring back Jase and Lauren  they were great loved listening to them on the way to work in the morning Are you kidding… 10 mil for these pair We’re much more sophisticated I have to instantly turn them off when they come on	 it’s bloody cringe. So what stay in Sydney we love you What  makes any person think they are worth 10million Good. I don't and won't listen to them. I love our own home grown. Because they’re not worth it. I miss Jade and Lauren in the mornings. Kyle and Jackie are to vulgar for morning radio They are not worth $2 and never have been? Put Jase and Lauren on our radios any day...they are both down to earth!! I am glad Jase’s show does well Crikey that means some Vic's can actually think That's because they're not!! Melbourne has more class Well	 to be fair	 their mics were on. Never liked either of them I think people in certain areas need to adjust their thinking to what’s important and what is fair and reasonable value. This certainly is not",2
"Never will I willingly listen to any radio station or watch free to broadcast tv Would never listen to Kyle No one is worth that much I listened out of curiosity today and it was embarrassingly bad millions for garbage... got to laff Fifi fev and nick blow these guys out the water	 give them the 10mill I am in Sydney and I can't even comprehend listening to any of this mind vomit. Kyle & Jackie who??? Never heard (of) them - thankfully! Sydney and Melbs radio is so different. That's because they aren't 100k is pushing it Hopefully Kyle and JO are off the airwaves soon Go back to Sydney Vile & Tacky O  = Vomit radio They're both flops I don’t understand why Jason and Lauren left I love them There not worth a million Personally I think Chase Lauren& Clint are the best!! They're awful	 both their shows are just dull and the same old shjt I've actually moved to nova for my morning radio	 so good to have Jase	Lauren and Clint  still Can't beat Christian on Gold Moved to Nova 100 as soon as Jase and Lauren were on the air	 all is right in the world again I personally think they’re crass! Love Jase and Lauren Highly operated cant stand them Not everyone Enjoys Sydney Characters Can’t stand Kyle Take ABC radio any day. Commercial radio is drivel. Triple M gippsland all the way They are on the way out and deservedly	 not funny for listeners and really boring He’s a dirty mouthed grub I guess it’s an age thing but who are they? Only good thing about them coming is Nova picking up Jase and Lauren. Nova audience scored!",7
"I don't find the big deal about them Pro because that Kyle is a complete idiot Please go back to Sydney we don’t want you. Would not listen if you paid me I’d never listen to him. Awful man They certainly aren’t! He is such an arrogant man. Somebody’s got far too much money if they given those idiots 10 million Go back where you came from Good  and hopefully goodbye 120k sounds about right Who still listens to radio? kyle and jackie o are just a wannabe howard stern show Melbourne are too smart for their juvenile antics Too crass. That’s because they’re not Clare Southwell no one is even close to being as amazing at Jase & Lauren Jase	 Lauren and Clint. Good! Jase and Lauren should have never been been replaced. Don't want to toot my horn but i could do a better job with duck tape over my mouth lmao    get rid of them..... Hmm let’s see: first thing in my day - meanness and nastiness or kindness and light n Gold104.3? They are both vulgar Writing was in the wall 10 mil. Are you high?! Who are these people Melbourne has always been more classy than Sydney and I come from NSW. Just a better taste. 10 million is outrageous give half to the homeless. Never liked them	 they are cheap entertainment	 they are bullies Crappiest radio ever with these two goons. No one is worth that much money per year Thought it was a stupid idea They are AWFUL What idiot gave that them the contract They are the reason I now listen to Spotify. It’s a bad rap for Sydney lol 	 they even aired a replay the other week as Kyle was mia …. And guessing kiss thinks Jackie o can’t do the show for a day by herself.. Melbourne resident Who got sick To listen to their show for about 5 mins as  my Sydney sider passenger asked fo… See more That's because they aren't worth that at all. They are actually worthless. Especially kyle the grub Should have been Jase and Jackie-o Bella Patman this comment section has restored my faith in humanity xx I wouldn't have thought they'd even be worth $10!! Melbourne obviously has more class than Sydney. Failed to Convince me. People only listen to them because they give away lots of money - prefer Jason and Lauren and Nova They aren’t worth $10. Jase and Lauren for ever funny watching Kyle and Jaquie fail they deserve it When I listen to radio it’s to hear music. I don’t understand how any of these radio presenters keep their jobs; all they do is talk (rubbish) and not play music",2
"Get Jackie o to show more cleavage	 that makes for good radio I wouldn’t pay them $10 a year. Um. Let's bump that down a couple of zeros WHO????? not so popular in Melbourne Prefer kyle and Jakie O over Jase and Lauren any day. Hate alauren always body shaming Jase Little more taste in Melbourne Can’t stand these 2 people Get rid of Kyle and the rating will improve Why is Kyle still on radio  dudes a flop Jase Lauren and Clint were so great Maybe if kyle would punch as much coke as jaqui he might lose some weight $10 million a year? All the people struggling to make ends meet with the inflation and rent increases	 working jobs that actually matter and these 2 are making $10 million a year?",3
"I can do the job for $1	0	0 Paying that salary for a part time job with no stress at all! What a joke. The world has gone mad. Noone is worth that sort of money. Kyle and Jackie O not what I expected	 a bit vulgar… back to Nova Jase and Lauren They talk too much! More music that's what we want! Welcome to Melbourne You don't change what was working I would not listen to these 2 And the old.folk on wsfm killing it Me. Melbourne people are are different breed to Sydney they both make my skin crawl Makes me sick how they speak... Talk about full on inappropriate stuff... I listened to it this morning and couldn't believe it's allowed... Come on Should NEVER have changed. We have moved over to NOVA for Jase n Lauren And now they get more publicity Both are so full of themselves Ridiculous..... very sad couple of people who think other wise about themselves I’m Spotify all the way now. Kyle has changed but spots are spots. Obviously we have more taste here in Vic. $10 million a year? Areyou kidding me I didn’t even think they’re worth $1 million a year. Their has beens! Time to move on and quit while they’re ahead! fouk back to sydney I don’t think they’re worth $1000 dollars a year. Total pants! Fifi fev and Nick all the way!!! That because they are not worth that much. Makes me laugh you cant even see his ears Good to see Melbournians have good taste Nobody is worth that much per annum Ratings are in and kyle and Jackie failed to convince Melbourne their worth $1 dollar and i couldn’t agree more.They are the most over rated pair on Television in my opinion.kyle being a judge on a talent show when he has no talent at all what absolute rubbish.",2
"Used by date long passed I’m dedicated TripleM	 so no chance of me listening to those two dribble on. Awful presenters and not in the slightest funny Not suitable for morning radio especially with kids in the car. EASY…THERE NOT FROM MELBOURNE Was never going to work from the start . Fifi 	fev and nick all the way . Suffer. Jase and Lauren for ever Of course. Jase and Lauren are more relatable. Worst mistake kiis made. They are on late here in SA and so glad  I'd hate driving to work having to hear these 2 They are absolutely not even worth it $10 Nova 100 Jason and Lauren are THE BEST!",3
"Yer	 they're like the Starbucks of radio. Who needs them when we've got better in Melb than a watered down wash-up dishwater!! Send them back to the convict state!!",2
"How much? Definitely not worth it. They are not suited for breakfast radio. School drop off time when kids are in the car. They’re chats are not child friendly I honestly don't understand how they get paid so much... who is funding it? Can’t understand why anyone likes what these two produce which is absolute crap Not for us in Melbourne…time to go Who'd listen to that creep Jase & Lauren are on Nova. Follow them over	 I have	 so have many others who want to listen to breakfast radio and not the inappropriate	 self obsessed bullshirt these two spout. Can't stand either of them! Radio is for cars made in the late 90’s… Even my work place streams music all day.. I don’t care that they are from Sydney. I don’t care where they come from. What I do care about is what I listen to and they just spew out garbage. Radio goes OFF or I change channels when they come on.",2
Tbh I don't understand their hype. Jase n Lauren all the way Shows what good taste us Melburnians have I drive my kids to school and hearing them and the way they talk with little ears in the car is not ok. Hence why 101.9 is what is listen to.,3
"Proves class is better than these two!! Regional taste. He’s a little overweight! Obscene amount of money! Have never listened and never will Couldn’t pay me enough to listen to them. And to be paid that much to be a radio host is absurd when they are nothing but vile. Nova all the way for me thanks Who frigging cares What great news How are they still around  they’ve been gross for years They’re terrible their worth northing Melbounians have more taste than Sydneysiders	 who’s have known Lauren and Jason all the way. Love listening to you guys in the morning How are they still relevant?",5
Wouldn't listen to them if you paid me Maybe they should stop talking about vile disgusting things during drop off.,4
"They're Sydney folk. We're different here. No acrimony	 just different substance. Let me find a vomit bag for these two souls.    Hope Vanity is worth your soul to the devil . Just jealous melbourne people Can’t stand both of them and their material is pathetic No one is worth 10 million a year just to yak on radio Kyle is just a sad old misogynist They should  pay  fifi  fev 	nick from  the fox10 million  dollars  each  they are awesome. They just talk constant filth. At least gold and other stations have something intelligent to say. That much money for… what do they actually do. But hey. Good for them. I’m just too stupid to do it.

"I am not sure anyone is worth $10 million a year Those salaries are a disgrace Why getting them from Sydney plenty of locals from melbourne Suprise suprise. Good old Vile and Tacky’O They are so inappropriate for breakfast radio It's not about worth	  It's about willingness to pay it. Can’t stand them I think mainly Melbourne people don’t have the ability to see the achievements in what they have done as self made people. This adds to the whole act. Which it is an act. Love it or hate it. It’s a performance	 they make people talk. Hats off to them a… See more",3
"Horror pair why them...thought they were worth anything Easy. Change  stations! Terrific news. They ain't worth that much Sydney listeners are obviously easily pleased!!! 104.3 for me Christian O’Connell They are boring Can’t stand the foul mouthed Gronk I dont like talk radio at all	 specially them two lol. Spotify for me 10 million… your bloody kidding. $10 million that is plan stupid So not worth it What's radio? Jared finally!! Can’t believe they are still on air Melbourne	 you have taste! Grab a shovel Kyle. Kyle is disgusting. Talks over people and uses derogatory statements. Can't stand them Best news I’ve had all day. How do they think anyone is worth that much. Melbourne has good taste in some things! Melbournians were loud and clear that we didn't want them.. hopefully now ppl get it and they are removed permanently",2
Switched to nova as soon as they canned Jase Lauren and Clint The bin army wins! I miss Jase and Lauren. Get rid of these two clowns asap! I’m team Christian O’Connell on gold . Would NEVER listen to these two .,2
"radio & tv tumors This is what I love about Melbourne Not worth 10mil A pair of overrated germs!!!! There incomes are obscene ridiculous Fox Fm any day of the week! Love Fifi Fev and Nick Nope already switched to nova Its the old Melbourne versus Sydney argument. They arnt worth it Thaaaaat’s a shame. Anyway Remove them please. Gold 104 need to change those bin stickers to K & Jackie Oh Oh…. Absolute rot & rubbish on our Melbourne airwaves Not worth the money Haters will be haters. They are real and funny people. I love listening to them and they are funny. I definitely switched too. I followed Jase and Lauren to Nova. A far better show	 in fact	 I don’t listen to KIISS anymore Hope they fail i do love I'm listen for the las 20years I love 2GB Intelligent people with a sense of humour and talk about real issues good or bad I start my day with Sammy J and always will. My radio dial skips past them. Who even listens to the radio anymore Pay Jase and Lauren more Go back to Sydney $10 million	 yet health care workers	 police	 teachers struggle to get remunerated correctly for the amount of work they do. Disgrace.",2
"Imagine what could be done with that money? They are just DJ's ffs It's been 3 weeks for official numbers. He overrated Well Sydney People are dumber than Melbourne People for sure. Who would have guessed Whatever idiot thought this was a good idea should be fired.  Appalling show. I gave up on them years ago How MUCH! Obscene. Bro they ain’t worth $5 bucks They are rubbish Cmon give them time lol It's only Kyle and Jackie O. Seriously who give a rats .... No one is worth that I think they are a disgrace Sydney dont listen to them either	 ratings are bullshite Who is worth $10mil a year seriously. ""I don't think they have ever been really well liked, it's the media spin that tries to make people like them.

"they are both creepy and hideous. i wouldnt listen to them if you paid me. get them off Told you Melbourne doesn’t them. How do they both have a job? Give Kyle the flick and see how Jackie O goes with a decent off-sider... 100 % feral... No surprise there What did they do to the executive to receive that pay packet? Certainly wasn’t their talent on air! Who are they ? How can they be paid so much to insult people first thing in the morning by being so vulgar on our Melbourne airways. Surely it not right to be driving kids to school or going to work and hearing disrespectful and disgusting information by these two.

That would be a better use of that kind of money instead they are flushing it away by p… See more Just play music!!! He's repulsive National embarrassments Australia 1 country but divided many states	 acting like different countries	 nothing works as 1 nations",4
Not worth it. Laurel and Hardy aren’t funny Gold 104 smokes them in the morning Flogs aren’t worth 10 cents Kylie and Jackie called the hospital a nurse gave information then Get this garbage off our radio,3
"Love them not boring like all the rest Both completely arrogant	 overrated and overpaid know it alls A pair    of    Dribblers   !!!!! I've now gone to Hughesy Ed & Erin for morning radio. I feel sorry for Melbourne They get young adults to undress themselves in the studio to see if the contests will sleep with each other and then pimp them our with a room so they can come back and talk about how good they were	 and that's morning radio",4
"I don't give a rats about the ratings	 in what world are two crap DJ's worth that sort of money? Go Jase and  and Lauren and Clint Still better than Will & Woody tho so all good Melbourne did tell you years ago we don't like these 2 Wouldn’t listen to them	 even if they were the only radio station available Would rather stream from another country Their content is awful...basically they promote degrading young woman and men. So who did the market research?? On the ya bikes u pair of nobody's. Simply no class	 crass doesn’t cut it. No ones worth ten mill a year don’t care who they are Nothing but vermin Kyle & Jackie nought I’m surprised that they have been on air this long given Kyle’s scandals over the years Didn’t even know they were on You'd have to pay me to listen to Kyle. Even then I couldn't",2
As soon as I hear either of their voices I change the station,4
yeah could have told you that already They're total Garbage ! Just Sydney garbage As predicted. Only desperates would listen to the drivel they spew out,2
No one is worth that much each year Bring back Rick Melbourne l say What a waste of money for these two.,3

I'd rather listen to 3aw can't stand jacki o and kyle get rid of them Can't stand them	 we have fifi	 fev and Nick don't need these two. They spit more crap than our politicians who don’t get paid that. Jase and lauren so much better Overpaid and over rated.",4
"Time to show them the door Why are they paid so much ?? Good. We switched stations When the headline doesn't fit the article.. 'However	 the results don't paint an entire picture	 given that the Kyle And Jackie O Show launched in Melbourne on April 29	 meaning its listenership is considered for three weeks out of the 11-week survey period.' ""Melbourne is not as toxic, so will not put up with their  """"shock jock"""" nonsense, MMM is playful, those 2 on Kiss, just toxic, shame, I used to like the 101."" I would listen to fox's morning show i just can't handle Fev. Who was stupid enough to pay them 10 million?? They’re not worth much at all to be honest let alone 10 million. But they’d go hand in glove with the vic government	 they’re a waste of money too Absolutely ridiculous paying salaries of $10 million Nah go home to Sydney Sucked in All that money and Kyle still hasn’t bought a mirror. Melbournians must have higher IQ. Who wants to listen to K&J rubbish???",3

Love listening to them from Melbourne talk about Melbourne. Kyle and Jackio O are terrible i cannot even look at a picture of them	dont expect me to listen to them Discusting they get paid that much to do f all. Why bother with narcissistic Media  types Jase and Lauren is so much better than Kyle and jacko Over paid and totally overrated ! They are rubbish Totally agree I’m from Sydney. Can’t and won’t listen to them. Self inflated egos. Send them back to Syd!! I didn’t even realise people still listened to the radio Kyle does my head in worst host in global radio Revolting! If their boss wants to pay them $10m a year	 good on them. Won’t be listening but I’m sure that they couldn’t care less Why are old people yelling on the bluetooth from beforetime?

I’m from Perth but give me Jase and Lauren any day What a vile show.... What a waste of money I don’t know how they get away with with the topic s they discuss on morning radio. I know they are shock jocks but this is rubbish and disgusting. The worst part is they get paid for it. Really no talent at all.

When I get a chance to listen to breakfast radio it’s Triple M Melbourne 105.1 Marty Sheargold all the way! Hilarious. I’m always amazed how Kyle is allowed to speak to his staff. The name calling	 the derogatory comments etc I’m sure it isn’t acceptable within normal businesses	 I wonder how he gets away with it? Don’t hold your breath!!! Victorians aren’t loving Kyle and Jackie O.. 10 million for what insults.? That’s because they’re both horrible people who get off on causing misery to others and gossiping",2

Kyle was good now he looks like he is about to have a heart attack Well over paid & not worth that at all	 really I suspected they may not land well with a Melbourne audience.",3

"Remove both all together  PLEASE. On ya bike! What the hell do they even do to be paid 10 million dollars a year? They never have been So very 'indicative' of those 'entitled ones'. It is endemic throughout the entire entertainment industry from Hollywood down to the local radio man/woman. Switched to nova. I wonder how long it will take before their bosses realise they made a very expensive mistake ! And that's surprising? We never wanted them when it was announced and we preferred the guys that were already in place. Shocking way they were removed. Hope they do the same to them. Wow so shocked that their ratings have tanked They belong in Sydney	  not Melbourne. We do not need their style of radio	  we love our local presenters.  Melbourne listeners  know what they want to listen to	  they will definitely turn to other stations. No radio presenters are worth what they are getting",2

Lived in Sydney for a few years and wouldn’t even listen to them then.,2

I don't have too many options having an old car but rather listen to nothing They’d be lucky to get near half of that Toxic couple Waste of money !!!!!!! 100$ at most take it or leave it I'm pretty stumped people listen to the radio still. I mean it's like free to air TV	 no one watches that anymore. And no im not young.",2

"Beyond me why anyone should get $10m for being on radio. people out their saving lives are worth way more than these greedy people. Absolutely OVER-RATED! There’s a really simple reason why…..

They're terrible They’re not THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN.  SAY NO MORE! Stop broadcasting in our city. Melbourne doesn't want either of you. Mackenzie Jase and Lauren all the way Melburnians are too smart and too classy for these two!

Argh Sydney FAIL !!!! Yippy It dropped over 11 weeks even though Kyle and Jackie were only were on 3 of those weeks because people boycotted KIIS for the dirty pulled on Jase	 Lauren and Clint. Will avoid KIIS wherever possible now as why support a station that treats it's employees so badly.. Love fox fm! Not surprising. They are terrible.

who are they..?? Definately not worth it!!,3
"No chance I’d listen to these clowns What a  joke you two are. good news Because Kyle & Jacky O have only been on air in Melbourne for only a small percentage of the  Melbourne ratings period.  The next ratings  will be the true induction. Washed up married couple. Never have been. Who r they? I turn them off as soon as I hear them	 both are arrogant	 self absorbed D listers who think themselves A’s! Only someone living in Sydney could be shocked by these ratings as the article states!! How many Sydney radio shows networked into Melbourne have ever been successful? How much????????????????? Who is??

"Noooooo they are not No there not worth 10m Who cares Pair of sht cnts $10M??? I thought a radio host would get about 100K-200K and maybe up to a million if they are famous. Why should they get paid that much for talking?

"NO ONE is worth $10 million a year	 especially not a radio announcer.",3
"Highly recommend the Melbourne based Light FM. 89.9. Wonderful programs	 kid friendly… it’s so important that we have a positive radio station that values the importance of fun but friendly and appropriate for young children and adults. Music is fantastic! Hoped for this outcome and expected it  switched to nova with Jase Lauren and Clint",2
Vile and tacky. Overrated  overpaid I like them  it’s controversial but I don’t think they should be played during school pickup/dropoff lol,2
Cuz they ain’t Slow news day Waste of time,3
"I really like listening to them but 10 million a year is a bit too much What a surprise! They are gross  and all part of the fake and ridiculous vitriol	 that is now the mainstream mindset! Yeah nah They have always been crap The reality is that their show is designed around Sydney culture which is very different to Melbourne - not saying one is “right” and the other “wrong” 	 just very different tastes and values. Why is that such a shock I could have told them that for free Surprise	 surprise. Every Time i see Kyle on the TV it makes me Sick",2
"get  rid  of  kyle   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx With so many people doing it so tough	 it's a bitter pill to swallow that for what they do	 they're paid so much!!  they literally contribute nothing to society	 I change the station specifically to avoid them & when I have been in an unfortunate sit… See more No surprise to Melbourne listening public. See ya Their extreme views and political leanings are not in line with the public",2
Not worth $10 I'd rather listen to static.,2
Disgusting that people with such little talent get paid so much,2
"They are over rated I don’t know how they keep getting renewed they have sucked for years I would rather listen to white noise than their show Well	 someone has to listen to them for them to ahve that kind of money!!!! Never rated either well personally	 they are both paid fmto bully people and talk down to anyone they don't agree with!! Sydney can keep them Oh no	 nope. Oh there so outdated Very cringe Guess what… because they’re not. No one is. I quite like them	 better than we getting Canberra Yea I don’t get them nor listen to them.. he talks crap and is shovanistic and prays on young innocent ppl to make the name for himself. They have big celebs on yes but who really cares. I stopped listening to kiis because they came on air. I’ve tried to listen more than a few times but just can’t 	 it’s actually sick these people are weird 	 is it how they really are ? Or just trying to be controversial by being crude ? This morning they were talking about people marrying their cousin 	 … See more Fifi	 Fev & Nick all the way can’t beat 101.9 The Fox Dont know how they conned Sydney! absolute bottom feeders They aren't worth 10 million cents	 let alone dollars.  Idk why anyone would listen to rubbish like this	 or the show they took over from	 when there are so many great choices in radio in Melbourne from the community stations like PBS	 RRR	 Plenty Vall… See more Good i love Jas and Lauren I think the Radio station should give them $500 and a plane ticket back to Sydney  and stay there permanently. Well 	their show is a breakfast show and most people have kids with them for school drops etc …the K&J show is not exactly kid /family friendly while Jase and Lauren is ..so not surprised Kyle is vile. Shallow sexualisation of every conversation. Just yuck. When they are on I switch over to a different station",2
Absolutely vile the both of them. Imagine thinking this was going to work!,2
"It makes me wonder about Sydneysiders	 if these two have been so successful for the last 10 or so years.. They are both Full of They got done for disablism	 racism	 sexism	 homophobia and even had a teenager open up about child sexual assault. They’re garbage gutter humour. Nova is better. Excellent. Pathetic the pair of them and sacking the others for the crap they both spew was a huggge mistake. Serve the company right. Did anyone actually read the article? Jack  we aren’t alone I switched They are not worth $1 a year. ...10 million a year wtf!!! I bet the executives are thinking how to retract that sum. Rating dont lie and  they've clearly have bet on the wrong people.  No comment. These 2 are not interesting at all. Should have stayed in Sydney. Overpaid crap Could told them that  Ruby Sykes Trying to get people in Melbourne to listen to 2 clowns from Sydney was never going to work ""Definitely not worth nearly that much.  """"Entitled nobodies."""""" Who? Stay out of melb fucknuckle s Never been a fan of Kyle or Jackie. I’d turn radio off if they were all I had to listen too.",2
"Certainly not my cup of tea. Nobody is worth that amount of money as a salary for any type of job	 especially a radio announcer. Fifi Fev and Nick No one in the world is worth that amount of money!   Crude and talk about topics for the bogan!",2
"I can’t stand Kyle and Jackie O Melburnians like listening to other Melburnians rather than a couple of tossers from Sydney. The radio station F'ed up big time thinking we would Overrated. BBM 98.7 FM the indigenous station in FNQ is by far the best. Money wasted for who.only please      give to Nurse's and Drs  who save lives not to those who joke and rant about nothing They’re not even worth the paper their IDs are printed on Christian O'Connell's show is so much better	  send them back	 they don't suit Melbourne and its obvious from the comments we can't stand them.",4
"Bc they're not. They’re just the worst of “shock jock” radio.. he’s just extraordinarily unpleasant! Just base (toilet) humour and gets off on demeaning people (even his co-host) and I don’t know why she puts up with his  type of “humour”	 (pardon me while cough on th… See more Yes they get paid far too much money.  Our doctors nurses and Ambulance officers don't get paid as well as these too it's a joke it was tried in the 1980's with AW & UE.  Melbourne is tribal with Aussie Rules and communist greens.Good luck in an impoverished bog hole Get rid if them absolutely disgusting bring back Lauren Phillips No way 10M. Maybe 100K max. Melbourne is a much tougher room that Sydney and Queensland. Can't win em all! Think Jason and Lauren will win this one. Horrible people both of them. The jokes on us...! Wouldn	t pay two bob to hear either of them I stopped listening to the station when they got rid of Jase	 Lauren and Clint.  I've moved over to NOVA now.  Kyle and Jackie O should never have been considered for Melbourne radio.  Big mistake! Not even $1M because they absolutely are not! they are toxic radio alot of the time and that money could be far better spent on things we need in the world 3AW all the way	 intelligence prevails Flogs Kyle is a mysognist  yuk shouldn’t be worth that much . all they talk about is rubbish and useless to society Bullies and a top notch wanka They are not Why do they need to get paid so much ? People talk about politicians should cut their salary but honestly why do these 2 need to earn so much	 could feed a lot of people with that money. I find  them irritating and won’t listen and change the channel if I see them on tv. Much prefer our local radio C91.3FM  with Ally Redondo in the morning",2
I think they’re being paid 10 million too much !! Who? They were only on air for 3 of the 10 weeks counted in the ratings- can’t wait for the next round to show the legends these two are Absolute rubbish - done and overdone!,2
"Geez	 he looks like he's on the verge of a heart attack",2
"I’m glad Melburnians didn’t think they were as good as they thought they were. Why can’t we just have Melbourne hosts talking to locals. That’s how we like it Who? All front	 no substance. Just not Melbourne",2
"Annoying	 I never want to hear a talk show. I prefer to listen to music without a stupid conversation. From lisners	 one sided people. Their show not suitable for breakfast/morning time	 okay for evening time slot Who is Kylo O and Jacky E???? You cannot be the champion all the time you got a higher time in your life	 and very low. Keep your chin up because nothing is forever. I can't stand them	their egos are bigger than their heads.i prefer 91.5.or 101.9.so much more fun. They’re not! They are horrible	 arrogant over paid narcissists. Why the hell would anyone listen to them? One looks like a recovering ice addict and the other looks like they inject KFC gravy into their veins.  em off. Biggest overrated pair Not worth the money 2 duds Never been a fan of them but don’t like people getting slammed either. No one knows the effect some of these comments have on these 2 people - and they are just people! Not even worth 1 million a year. What a waste of money. Won't be listening when these clowns are on Kyle is a no talent  bum Gold 104.3 all the way",4
"Huge surprise. We don’t like listening to right wing shock jock misogynists…. Vile and tacky. As soon as Kyle said he hated the AFL 	 it was all over	 stick to your crap NRL and leave our airwaves!! Over rated rubbish Total crap in Sydney hardly likely in cactoria I was sad that Jase and Lauren and Clint are no longer in the kiisI was sad then my daughter told me to listen to to nova was very happy that Jase Lauren and Clint . I am from Sydney but I never liked Kyle and Jackie o  send them back to Sydney . wow how overpaid can you get!!!!",2
Someone who just dribbles crap on a radio station for a few hours most definitely ain’t worth that…. If that’s the case I should be on at least 30 mil a year doing a real job…entitled much?,2
"Jab pushes you both will pay for your actions just like everyone else.. People need to stop listening to these losers. Not a good commercial decision. Revolting	 bai! Kylie and Jacko? no thanks!!! I only switch to Kiis to listen to Will & Woody (who I find hilarious). At all other times	 I’m a Fox listener. Melburnians are fairly loyal to our own home grown stars. We never needed these two to beam in from Sydney. Ridiculous move. Who ? Alan Jones only lasted 6 months in Melbourne. Loud same as Jackie O and Kyle. Ego's to big. Go home and don't come back. Tom Elliot is at least sensible.",2
"WHO EFEN CARES	 some of us have lives And Kyle needs to clean his cars out of the disgusting rubbish and cigarette butts	 my brother refused to work on his cars. And even Tamara’s sister had no contact with her because of him. Not that Tanya’s kids were nice either entitled brats. It says good things about Melbourne Dan Sanga - Christian O’Connell for the win Would not listen to their nonsense Joke but sadly it ain’t	 he’s just a self serving ignorant grossly overpaid mouthpiece	 she’s the same but better looking.",2
"Looking like a used pineapple kyrle Can't stand them. Shock jocks are so out dated Kyle and Jackie have got even cruder 	 no wonder they are losing listeners	 Lauren and Jase on Nova are far better and now my preferred listening",2
"These two give a whole new meaning to bogans!!! The actual rot that they spew on air is so stupid. These two are typical cashed up bogans. Never listen to mainstream radio. To much verbal diarrhoea much prefer local community radio. Jackie and Kyle had the talent of a cow pat. Stay in Sydney	 Melbourne don’t take rejects They are just distasteful these days. Too much rubbish. Humour is good but they go too far. Jase and Lauren every day of the week. Join the bin army ! Nothing they’ve ever said is worth listening to so I don’t see how they can even be worth more than the dirty dollar I found on the floor Pay them what for what? Can't believe they generate 100 million dollars. Usually they get paid 10% of revenue. not worth $10. it's pathetic what they get I agree	 spent several hours this fortnight listening to them and very disappointed with the subject matter	 acceptance of drug use and sexual issues as a major subject They used to be ok now they are horrible I hate the show Never found either funny I love listening to Kyle and Jackie O talk about bl*w jobs!",2
"Please send them back to Sydney.. I cant stand them at all.. Triple M 	 Classic Rock Digital	 thank you",4
Kyle is a Kane Cornes wannabe that,2
More educated audience in Melbourne Yes Christian O’Connell show is so much better!!!,2
The fact anybody gets paid this much with 0 physical labour involved is a joke,2
"I find this kind of thing disgusting when we have so many people struggling to stay afloat.  Then	 we have these self-absorbed	 self-promoting delusional individuals in a wide range of industries and Government positions who really believe they are wor… See more Who even listens to radio? Just stream your favourite music....",3
I switched radio stations because of these two.  Such c**p they go on with. Super overrated now. I used to listen to them when they first started out together and they were ACE. Now it’s just rubbish. I mean Kyle. See he is that important that I can’t even get the name right but the bottom line is that he is an arrogant twit. Could have told you that,4
Edward Singh 10 million a year 10 million a year and you think they care about ratings or what anyone thinks of them. They could both retire comfortably tomorrow. Just a money grab now … See more Corey Smark not working out for them!! I wouldn't even give them half a million,2
"Not classy enough for Melbourne. (Not saying Sydney isn't classy- just those 2	 lol). The show isn’t the same since they went to Melbourne. Lost their personal touch. Such a shame. Melbourne will be the death of them in my opinion Why listen to the radio. Play your own music in the car. Nothing against them either way but I can't listen to it because there are so many adds when they are on. Gotta pay the 10 million some how. Jase and Lauren all the way! I’d rather just put on my Martin/Malloy cds",3
"should be kyle and jackie go It’s obscene how much money they get for what they do! Shameful Their number 1 in Sydney FM with about 15% market share so 85% of people hate them. See what happens with a 10 week survey but there will be a lot of money given away on air 	so will help all the Melbourne stations increase there give aways Who would of thought Melbournenite had more brains then Sydneyites HOW MUCH??? No one is worth that money apart from someone who saves life’s. What a joke paying that kind of money; top CEO’s of companies that have enormous staff earn that kind of money. These two are vulgar and somehow they’ve convinced other idiots to pay them that kind of money Jase and Lauren all the way This is why I listen to triple J	  but even that has gone a bit off in past 2 or 3 years. Ipod play list or spotify pod casts my go too now. They are the worst We live in Victoria we want to hear about Victoria not nsw just like the morning shows get sick and tired of nsw stuff not Victorian Sandilands hasn't been worth the money for years..out of the two	I prefer Jackie.. but do I believe their worth 10 million a year	no I don't. You could find others just as good for half of that...overall the pair are overpaid and overrated.. the bubble… See more Delusions of grandeur",2
"Great bogans	 their conversations are for low social degenerates that can’t think for themselves and depend on these two to learn how to spell DOG!! Not interested at all. Go back to NSW.",2
"It’s really an inspiration for the younger generation to see that if you have zero talent	 a coke addiction	 and a loud opinionated whiny voice you can earn significant money on talk radio. Whom ever thought this was a good idea needs to go! Even the gAyBC beat them in the ratings",2
"Wow	 look at all the haters getting off on this. Yes I don't like what they talk  about at the Hour if the day And get away with it. Some of there comments and topics are not appropriate for that time of the morning.… See more Unpopular opinion I LOVE THEM I don’t think their content is relatable to Melbourne. They are very Sydney focused. That’s not their fault	 that is where they broadcast from. Jase and Lauren all the way. Moved to Nova with them.",2
All they talk about is filth on the radio,2
"Shock jock radio is so early 2000s. Learn about your new demographic or fail miserably. Pleeeeaaaaaase bring back Jase and Lauren.  That said	 given the dreadful way they were treated they probably wouldn't come back!  Maybe Humphrey & Fat Cat?  They'd still do better thann  Kyle & Jacki. No one is worth $10million a year….if they want to relate to the average person they should accept an average wage and donate the rest to the country’s hospital system and other charities. Melbourne will vote with their hearts. They got that salary regardless of Melbourne. We are getting them for free. Sydney have them for that coin	 Kiss Melbourne are happy. An absolute disgrace. Actual Melbournians struggling to earn good money and these 2 are getting millions. No where near worth it ! You will never beat Fifi	 Fev and Nick I cant stand sandylands ill never watch any show he's associated with. Who? I would rather listen to .... HELLOOO... frank walker from national tiles .. on repeat then any of these people talk on my way home.! Why inflict cockroaches on Victoria? Kick them back over the border and set Baygon baits for them. Victoria had their own talented DJ’s. They’re not worth $10 dollars  a year between them!!! Definitely not worth even 1 million. Their show is rubbish. They are worth a half eaten ham and cheese sandwich I have changed to listen Nova 100 now Who??? Gold 104.3 The Christian O'Connell Show for the win i couldnt imagine anything that would convince me to listen to them Woukd not pay five cents a day to listen to their crap Sydney people must be stupid then. They are overpaid to do what No like. Find them very distasteful!Even commenting gives them Oxygen Puppets get compensated for distracting the general population from what's happening in the world. If you want to make lot of money go and deceive be an entertainer. Same goes for sports stars	 actors	 etc. Jase and Lauren anyday! Anybody can get on a radio and talk gutter crap....not worth 10m I can't believe people still listen to commercial radio! Utter garbage and pointless That's cos they're crap They used to be great	 not anymore. Same old	 same old!! Those two  arnt even 5 cents  I would  rather listen to  billy brownless and James brayshaw  then listen to kyle and Jackie o I struggle to comprehend how they	 or anyone in that pseudo celebrity type of role	 are worth even $100k per annum when many important and needed professions earn less. Don’t mind her but can’t stand Kyle",2
They are offensive and arrogant ! Obscene amount of money for two unpleasant people. Lucky we have choice in Melbourne. My favourite has and always will be hughesy and kate been listening them from day one when nova was realised Who? Beau Woods don’t you love the media Yasss the Gold104.3  bins win!!!!! This is the only article about these 2 I will actually like.,2
Money For Nothing??? Radio is dead. Podcasts are the new GOAT,2
They are the best!!,6
"In fairness to kyle and J-oH their fans both have what would be considered as	 but not limited to	 an opinion. The twice I have listened to them I really enjoyed them . That’s sad. A breath of fresh air but Victorians are pretty stayed in their ways.",3
I get there show it’s A winner driving in the Sydney traffic I get a laugh  and I won’t listen to any others they have A grate show  it’s full of flavour I pay for a music subscription so I don’t have to listen to people like this,2
If I turn on the radio and they’re on I change stations. Who? Just a couple of foul mouthed boguns!!,3
This made my morning.. Jas & Lauren love these two..,4
"I can't turn it on in the morning on the way to primary school due to the swearing ""Doesn't f#ck""""n bother me"" I’m not suprised. He is why Cancel culture  started How they’ve lasted this long is beyond me! Glad I‘ve never listened to them! Gutter mouth radio Seriously who NEEDS that much a year? It's just greedy and Kyle has all his other business interests..Pathetic with the way this country has gone	 now. Tried to listen but it became just like every b/fast program boring?. Just the usual crap with commercials.",2
I’m sorry but I have changed to Nova I dont like how they speak to their listeners and there is so many inappropriate things while I’m taking my son to school.,2
"Because they’re NOT!! They wouldn’t know the first thing about the Montague St Bridge. Pathetic		times up		go back to Sydney. It’s not shock radio. Who? Sydney talk radio programs don't work in Melbourne it been tried before. they are rubbish! Nobody is worth that much money just for talking Rubbish on the radio	when you think there is so much poverty!!! Not worth 5.00 a year Long live frenzal romb",2
"Never going to work in Melbourne. Like they care what you think of them. Not F##KING LICKLEY The ratings survey went for 10 weeks	 and Kyle and Jackie were only on air in Melbourne for 3 of those weeks................... Get rid of kyle and people Might listen!!!he is a very arrogant person who's opinion on everything is of no matter!!! Nor relevant as the ratings were only measure for 3 out of 11 weeks. 2 discussing human beings. Social criminals. I am surprised they even have audience. I wish they would expand to Adelaide. Every breakfast show here is so boring and safe. I end up listening to Kyle and Jackie O on the iheart radio app anyway. I don't understand why we just don't have national breakfast shows like we do with drive shows. I love Jase and Lauren and now no longer listen to KiSS since they got booted off. Bad Bad Bad decision KiSS",2
Both are just egotist Don't care in the slightest what these out of touch sellout-brities say. The quicker this pair disappear from Melbourne radio will be bonus for Victoria No way! Pay this amount towards St Vinnies or to those who actually do things in life that meaningful and helpful Who have they convinced? You'll never get me to listen to anything that Sandilands is part of.,2
Over paid and over rated,2
Victorian's probably don't like listening to complete dribble That’s easy THERE NOT Who  ?? Worse decision they made getting rid of jase and Lauren Cause Melbourne's full of soy boys Kyle and Jackie O are putrid and vile! Don’t want to listen to them in Newcastle either!! What awaste of money donate it to the homeless Krystal Lewis-Smith i know this will make your day like it did mine No1 is worth that much Cant stand him! They are awful.,2
"Can they not be here in Melbourne??? They don't deserve that much. Go back to Sydney Bring in the Christian O'Connell show I've heard them a few times Pakenham = Paaykenham Cranbourne = Craanborne Williamstown - minus the S Potty mouthed bores	 tried listening once	 never again Seriously cancel them and fix our pot holes with their salaries thanka They are probably one of the worst to be homest I wonder how many of the people that actually listen are just waiting for a song! They are both Sydney people and should stay there Great news Kyle will cry now",2
"I work across the 3 states	 the difference in sense of humour is massive and Lauren	 Jase & Clint going great is the icing on the cake. KIIS can  theirs & Melbourne/Naarm’s Bring back Jase & Lauren ! The stuff they talk about in the morning having kids in the car for school morning drop off is not so appropriate Can't stand the sight of Kyle let alone having to listen to him. And this is why society is falling apart. Too much unearned value put on idiots like this and not enough spent on the important things necessary for everybody . Not worth talking about",2
"They are crap I wouldnt listen to them if i was paid a million dollars.. they are too full of themselves.. Sadly they use to be good. Now they focus on crass 	 vulgar content to shock you while you’re having your morning coffee. I’m not shocked anymore just disappointed. Your show needs more depth and I will switch back on. In fairness	 their show was on air in Melbourne for only 3 weeks of that 10 weeks that was surveyed.",2
I wouldn't give 2 bob for them Tayla Elizabeth I’m guessing your gonna tell me all about this tonight Commercial radio stations are like one long toothpaste advert Sorry but no radio host should ever earn that much. Just plain crazy Not surprised - overrated and bad taste,2
Dream on… they are rubbish I have never wanted something to fail more than this radio show in Melbourne,2
"Who pays these clowns $10m a year? To listen to absolute rubbish? They're neither entertaining nor are they value for money. I fail to understand why lifesaving paramedics and firefighters must beg for a pay rise and better equipment to protect the community	 yet these two offensive clowns get paid millions. There not worth that",2
"Give me 1 million a year for 2 years and I could be as obnoxious as those two together	 and then retire lol Already wildly disinterested	 the aggressive promotion put me off Completely over rated just full of them selves. Wankers the pair of em. They are not worth $10 million They call that	 entertainment. Huhhh !!! Overpaid and over rated... Stay focused on your audience. The eastern suburbs of Sydney and every flog who lives in it. Enjoy the 3 hour journey to travel 5 k. Bogans Much prefer to listen to gold FM. Christian O’Connell. Love the sense of humour from those folks",2
"ok im on 2uuu friday arvos and sat morning on with the big k 104.5 nowra we are so popular and topical not crass at all ............ move over Kyle is a flog. If heard the dribble they go on about can't see why they get paid that much Victorians of course. They are beyond woke	 no wonder they don’t get Kyle and Jackie O’s show! Good show	 get rid of them Go back to Sydney They are both grubs. Not worth 10 bucks. I wouldn’t feed them.",2
I think there would be a few directors from kiss feeling a little red faced right now knowing how much money they have wasted on these two bananas I hope a few upper management loose there jobs from some of the poor decisions they have made It’s a no brainer …. No one is worth a wage of that much. Not worth 10c,2
"Suffer in your jocks Glad we can get it here in QLD I'd rather listen to Christian	 Patsy and Jack. Atleast they have great personalities.  These two are empty shells. Both of you are not worth a fraction of that 10 million lol try double that After slacking off Melburnians during the Covid era	 hope Kyle goes home with his tail between his legs Well...obviously not a peoples choice..but someone else's just to give away 10mil..think I'll go watch Judge Judy now...",2
"Bye see ya shut the door on the way out They need to be replaced	 they are the worse segment on KIIS 97.3FM How stupid are the owners to offer that much money to gong beaters Dumbest radio shot ever	they talk about the most idiotic topics out there. Both got brain worms. I’m No radio presenter(s) are worth 10m a year. especially	 these two. Millions wasted. Could be put to good use somewhere else. A w and a bimbo without a  - great combination.",11
That's what happens when you mess with Melbarians. Gold104.3 fm for me!! Or NOVA No one is worth 10 million a year! Gtfo!!,2
"Lauren is better Nothing good about Commercial FM.. That money could be used to help many charities Lauren Phillips is so beautiful JackiO is terrible Intellectual pygmies. Total cliches. Haven't got an original	 creative bone in their bodies. And looking at that photo of Sandilands it's a SUBSTANTIAL body. And as for Jackie O'no	 the words mutton and lamb were invented for her. Eat the rich I'd rather listen to cats fighting at night Well I guess they'll get the spin doctors out	 and try to convince Melbourne that we need them. Sooner or later the realization will bit the bosses that their just not entertaining in any way !!!!! Ten million......and what return do you get for that??… See more Get over yourselves Cause they’re not worth it! 10 million that is ridiculous not worth that nope That rating is actually good for them as far as Victoria goes. Even if they were to go now	 they’ve made the big bucks and are laughing all the way to the Ya think??? Melbs would not think they were worth $10 ! Because they aren’t worth that. Simples Kyle and Jackie O should walk into the ocean and never turn back We cling on to these Australian celebrities way past their use by date honestly. Who are they??? Who would listen to these two anyway",2
"If you don’t like change the station	 obviously they are on radio for a reason	 I bet you people complain about spilt milk. Go away we don’t need listeners like you lot.. WOULD  NOT listen to that creep in a million years!  Victoria DOES not want him! Unsurprising",2
Joey Henderson sucked-in Melbourne. I can't stand hearing kyle's annoying voice The ratings are wrong.... !!! Give me the ABC any day Tip - run a segment on the Melbourne-Sydney rivalry. Don’t get it Sydneysiders? Melbourne will Early days guys !!,5
"i switched when i heard they were broadcasting i followed jas  and lauren hate listening to kyle’s crap Immediately removed “Kiss” from my presets. There is no way! I’m not listening to that rubbish in the morning by accident!!! Go back to Sydney and let us listen to local radio presenters! They both have about as much talent as an empty shoebox	 l don't know how anyone could pay them the amount of money there on. Good can’t stand them NOBODY is worth that much money 	 I don't care what they do ! I've heard their show a couple of times and I wasn't really impressed . VOMIT MATERIAL And the nurses can’t even get CPI increases over the last decade….. something very wrong with this picture Not worth a slab and a pack of Winny blues No thanks and Carrie Bickmore  all annoying Brisbane doesn’t want them either That type of salary is utterly insane. I can’t stand either one of them I’ve turned off their station in Sydney for years now Jackie is mentally challenged and looks like a chewed up Kebab from spanians new Kebab shop! Best friend's  for life's Serge Rey Brenden Roberts told ya Asoon as I here them 			nope channel changed instantly.. Tommy Taylor hahaha I’m so glad!!! Who? No one’s worth that amount.

"They are just awful….. Jase and Lauren all the way best ever My life is not that miserable that I need these two to prop me up I didn't know people still listen to radio Yeah nah not a fan of them. Moved over to nova now for Jason and Lauren. They aren't Garbage in	 garbage out . Such a gross couple. And the way their predecessors were shafted was disgusting. Kyle is yuk.  Sorry that’s the only word I can use that fbook will allow I can't believe that that flog is still doing radio and that people actually listen to the flog.... It's a damning stat that reflects the low level of mentally of the population in which his dribble broadcast too.... Because they talk absolute rubbish. Yeah too bogan Sydney banter",2
"Doesn’t impact me	 never turned them on Can't stand them two. Who? Concieted opinionated etc",2
"Can't stand them Could've paid me $10 million to tell you they are useless!!! From Melbourne	 I just spiteful that Show is being made in Sydney and not being made in Melbourne",3

As a sydneysider	 they also fail to convince me their worth lol Kyle is worth a kick in the doodle and nothing more 10m each? Jesus I have to tune in now just to support them. Steve price must be having a ‘chuckle’ with the latest ratings!",2
"Waste of money sucked to person that paid all that	should brought a car or house or boat or anything lol lol Worst decision KIIS made They need to be sacked Such sad news Fat red donuts are no good on radio. isn't it that if people want that kind of fake drama these days they just go on tik tok... Don't like either of them & Karl is an overpaid egomaniac!!! Here in Melbourne we don’t do crass. Can't stand them. Young people like the badly behaved	 they find it amusing. 10 million a year	where does the money come from?what do they do to	talk on the radio for a couple of hours	that's ridiculous This radio station must have a hell of a lot of money to throw away Take them off!

I would listen to 774 before them",3
Iv said it before and I’ll say it again NOBODY and I mean nobody at all outside of Sydney cares about these 2.. Horrid radio Can’t stand them Yaaay Ten mil a year what a f..Ken joke. This two are the worst. Is just cheap and bad radio. What a big mouth boof head he is . He’s flat out tying his shoe laces up Kyle Both entitled and not worth that money ever,2
Good for a laugh on the way to work in the morning. Wouldn't waste my time on them wasted time of my life Flogs Jase & Lauren all the way. Even my kids have a giggle. Way better than Kyle and Jackie O drivel and Fox crap,51
What a laugh that was ...10 million who would pay that much..for them pair. No thank you,10
Nowhere near left wing enough for Victorians Nothing but filth They are overpaid flogs!,2
Who ? Kyle ugh Not even worth $10,21

Big money for little talent. P off Ridiculous amount of money for what they do! Wont convince me.  Trashy  is a word  that comes to mind.,4
Overated fuktards Go back to Gaylord Mardi grass Sydney homos would listen to them Not even worth $10,3
Idiots Well duh I could have told you that noone is Move On ... no wait... Melbourne still has r-a-d-i-o ??? Old fat guts not as popular as he thinks. That's because they're not.. I've lived in Sydney all my life & am appalled these 2 idiots are still on air. Let's not even start on the Easter show exposure.. Watching grass grow is far more appealing then listening or watching these 2 morons.. Can’t stand them. Mary Strickland Waste of air time not funny or interesting Grubby & predictable ! Quite boring !,6
"Who are they? No names Only thing making 10 million in Melbourne is the revenue for the local junkie injection rooms. Stupid people	  Stupid listeners Some fool pays them 10 mil?",3
They are a waste of space and airtime,35
"To do actual what ? Dribble bs Fifi	 Fev & Nick",2
"Love Lauren Who I am with Jase& Laurent You losers	 read the stats.. 3 of 11 weeks. I’ve never seen such a bunch of left wing I stand with Dan morons in my life Sydney -celebrities-personalities-don't fit with the Melbourne ethos- Gold digger Wankers 10 mill!!?? Gees. Spend the money on other things that are actually worth it. Not inflating their egos and big heads..",8
K&J …… Highly overrated. no surprise there Not worth 10cents a year,26
"Love Jase & Lauren on Nova 100 Time to go 	send em back to Sydney Fancy wasting millions on these 2 jerks Not worth half a mil",2
Go to hell Kyle Where's Frenzel Rhomb when you need them Sheree Anne how funny is this! Nobody's worth that,3
